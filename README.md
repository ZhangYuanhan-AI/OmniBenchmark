## Webpage Template

This template was originally made by [Phillip Isola](http://web.mit.edu/phillipi/) and [Richard Zhang](http://richzhang.github.io/) for a [colorful project](http://richzhang.github.io/colorization/), and inherits the modifications made by [Jason Zhang](https://github.com/jasonyzhang/webpage-template).
See how the webpage looks [here](https://elliottwu.com/webpage-template/).

To use this template, clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/elliottwu/webpage-template
```

Copy the contents into a `gh-pages` branch of a GitHub repo. That will automatically
make a webpage under address [GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME](GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME).

Don't forget to update the Google Analytics script!
